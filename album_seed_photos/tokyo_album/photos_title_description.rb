    title: "Geisha in Gion",
    description: "I was in Kyoto exploring the historic Gion district. Gion in Kyoto is one of the last places in Japan that still has an active Geisha District. Geisha have worked in Gion for more than 300 years. There is something beautiful and mysterious about a geisha. They are a moving, living, breathing works of art. Graceful, elegant and playful all at the same time."

    title: "246 in Shibuya",
    description: "I love all of the levels out behind Shibuya Station. A very cool maze of highway overpasses, foot bridges, many lines of traffic and elevated train lines (behind me in this photo). It is amazing to see how complicated and intricate all of this is yet works at the same time. Take a minute and take notice of the excessive use of traffic cones. Think of this like one of those ‘Where’s Waldo’ pictures."

    title: "KomyoIn",
    description: "Kyoto is an amazing place. Some of the smaller temples and shrines you could walk right past and not realize it was even there. The name of this Zen temple, “Komyo”, consists of two kanji characters; ”ko” – light of the sun and “myo” – light of the moon or stars. When combined, these mean the light given off from the body of Buddha, or wisdom / mercy of Buddha."

    description: "I don't think I would ever drive a Mini or even comfortably fit in one but I love to photograph them. Especially the old ones that are all over Tokyo. There is just something about them that make them such a great subject to shoot. "
